# 🔐 Password Strength Meter
I built this Password Strength Meter using Streamlit to analyze and evaluate the security of user passwords. The app checks whether a password meets essential security criteria and provides actionable feedback to improve weak passwords. Additionally, it includes a password generator to suggest strong, random passwords.

# 📌 Features
Password Strength Check:

Validates password length (minimum 8 characters).
Checks for uppercase and lowercase letters.
Ensures at least one numeric digit (0-9).
Requires one special character (!@#$%^&*).
Strength Categories:

✅ Strong: Meets all security requirements.
⚠️ Moderate: Missing one security component.
❌ Weak: Fails multiple security checks with improvement suggestions.
Password Generator:

Generates a strong, 12-character password with a mix of letters, digits, and special characters.
Interactive UI:

Easy-to-use interface powered by Streamlit.
